          <h2 id="the_score">The Score</h2>
          <p>We've been working with The Score since August 2007 to develop a best-of-breed mobile sports platform.</p>

          <p>The Score is serious about being a first-mover in the mobile space and our agile development process has delivered quick turn-around for new devices and features.</p>

          <p>We developed the Score Mobile backend using Ruby on Rails and have scaled it up to handle over 20 million hits a month. We've grown the platform to support over a dozen sports leagues which serves data for all of Score Mobile's devices including the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoremobile-iphone-edition/id285692706">iPhone App</a>, <a href="http://www2.thescore.com/scoremobile/blackberry.aspx">Blackberry App</a>, and <a href="http://m.thescore.com/"mobile website</a>.</p>

          <p>On the front-end we've designed and developed The Score's mobile website and iPhone App. We've managed to deliver a great user experience while consistently iterating on the app to deliver features such as live in-game updates, game blogs, and video hilights. But don't take our word for it; to date the app has had over 1.5 million downloads and sports a 4-star status with over 15,000 reviews.</p>

          <h2 id="community_lend">CommunityLend</h2>
          <p>In January 2010 we helped launch CommunityLend.com, Canada's first peer-to-peer lending platform. Having worked with CommunityLend since 2007, we iterated over prototypes that brought them through multiple rounds of fundraising. To date, the platform has processed $100,000 in loan applications and registered over 700 Borrowers and Lenders.</p>

          <p>CommunityLend makes use of extensive integration with external services in order to verify user identity (Equifax eID Verifier), query the user's credit bureau (Equifax iDecision), and make deposits from and withdrawals to user bank accounts (Portfolio Plus). CommunityLend has been featured prominently in international journals such as The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Post, Investment Executive and The Globe and Mail.</p>

          <h2 id="targetivity">Targetivity</h2>
          <p>In early 2009 we were approached by the founders of Targetivity to revamp their ad-network platform: Affsession, a web-based business intelligence tool geared toward analyzing revenue streams associated with social media advertising.</p>  

          <p>The Affsession platform presented a distinct set of requirements around gathering real-time, transient statistics and presenting them in a number of complex reports. After a review of Affsession's existing setup, we broke ground with Rails worked alongside Targetivity's founders to rapidly iterate over the design, explore requirements, and develop features. Extensive unit and functional testing helped to ensure a seamless migration of their production environment, which is especially important for a business based on having constant uptime. The migration to Rails and an extensive test suite have since ensured rapid maintenance, adaptation, and feature development. In turn, this has helped Targetivity deal with rapid growth amongst the ever-changing landscape of social media.</p>

        <h2>iPhone</h2>
        <p>We're seeking new clients who share our passion for delivering elegant software experiences. Successful software projects can no longer rely on designer mock-ups being "thrown over the wall" to software developers. Design and development requirements need to considered as a whole for delivering the best solution to end users. We're also not in the business of writing feature specifications. We see immense value in getting real working software in front of real users as quickly as possible. All projects start with at least one developer and designer working with you to determine minimum requirements for delivering usable software to your users. At each step, we'll integrate user feedback to quickly iterate and improve on your application. </p>

        <h2>iPad</h2>
        <p>Whether you're looking to establish your mobile presence, or you want to launch the next killer application, we can help you bring your ideas to fruition. From initial brainstorming, to design and mockups, to implementation and onto the iTunes App Store, we can turn your idea into reality. We've been writing apps since the App Store was first launched, on iPod, iPhone and iPad platforms, with our apps having millions of users and installations.</p>

        <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>For the last 3 years we've developed web applications exclusively with Ruby on Rails to deliver rich user interfaces using standards-based HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We know our tools inside-out whether it be scaling a Rails server to handle millions of hits a month or creating highly optimized javascript for dynamic mobile <br/>web applications.  </p>
