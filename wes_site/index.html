          <h2 id="the_score">The Score</h2>
          <p>We've been working with The Score since August 2007 to develop a best-of-breed mobile sports platform.</p>
                    
          <p>The Score is serious about being a first-mover in the mobile space and our agile development process ensures quick turnaround for new device platforms and features.</p>

          <p>We developed the ScoreMobile back-end using Ruby on Rails and have scaled it up to handle over 20 million hits a month. We've grown the platform to support over a dozen sports leagues which serves data for all of ScoreMobile's devices including the<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoremobile-iphone-edition/id285692706">iPhone App</a>, <a href="http://www2.The Score.com/scoremobile/blackberry.aspx">Blackberry App</a>, and <a href="http://m.The Score.com/">mobile website</a>.</p>

          <p>On the front-end we've designed and developed The Score's mobile website and iPhone App. We've managed to deliver a great user experience while consistently iterating on the app to deliver features such as live in-game updates, game blogs, and video hilights. But don't take our word for it; to date the app has had over 1.5 million downloads and sports a 4-star status with over 15,000 reviews.</p>

          <h2 id="community_lend">CommunityLend</h2>
          <p>In January 2010 we helped launch CommunityLend.com, Canada's first peer-to-peer lending platform. Having worked with CommunityLend since 2007, we iterated over prototypes that brought them through multiple rounds of fundraising. To date, the platform has processed $100,000 in loan applications and registered over 700 borrowers and lenders.</p>
          
          <p>Internally, CommunityLend uses a enterprise Ruby adapter to allow the front-end website to integrate with the full suite banking platform on the back-end. This results in the application producing similar results to the expected human interaction with the loans and investments modules. </p>

          <p>Externally, CommunityLend makes use of extensive integration with third-party services in order to verify user identity (Equifax eID Verifier), query the user's credit bureau (Equifax iDecision), and make deposits from and withdrawals to user bank accounts (Portfolio Plus). CommunityLend has been featured prominently in international journals such as <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, the <em>Financial Post</em>, <em>Investment Executive</em>, and <em>The Globe and Mail</em>.</p>

          <h2 id="targetivity">Targetivity</h2>
          <p>In early 2009 we were approached by the founders of Targetivity to revamp their ad network platform: Affsession, a web-based business intelligence tool geared toward analyzing revenue streams associated with social media advertising.</p>  

          <p>The Affsession platform presented a distinct set of requirements around gathering real-time, transient statistics and presenting them in a number of complex reports. After a review of Affsession's existing setup, we broke ground with Rails worked alongside Targetivity's founders to quickly iterate over the design, explore requirements, and develop features. Extensive unit and functional testing helped to ensure a seamless migration of their production environment, which is especially important for a business based on having constant uptime. The migration to Rails and a high-coverage test suite have enabled fast turnaround for maintenance, adaptation, and feature development. In turn, this has helped Targetivity deal with rapid growth in the ever-changing landscape of social media.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy and Process</h2>
        <div class="column col_1">
          <p>We absolutely love working with clients who share our passion for delivering compelling software experiences to their end users. We provide both design and development services under a single roof, which reduces communication overhead and exposes requirements to everyone involved. This allows us to deliver elegant, pragmatic, and adaptable solutions that fit our customers' evolving needs. All projects start with at least one developer and one designer alongside you to determine minimum requirements and, at each step, we integrate user feedback to quickly iterate and improve upon your application.</p>  
        </div>
        
        <div class="column col_2">
          <p>We employ modern tools and techniques backed by best-practices and years of collective experience to build robust, scalable, and reliable products. Moreover, we strive to deliver code that is understandable, maintainable, and concise. Your time and money spent with us is an investment; you should not expect anything but the best.</p>

        <h2>iPhone</h2>
        <p>While many of today's cell phones can browse the web and download specialized applications, such functionality is often an afterthought. The iPhone, by contrast, is a fully-fledged platform that has come to define the state of the art in mobile applications. We have been writing apps since the App Store was first launched and are now eagerly exploring the upcoming release that supports background processes and multitasking. Whether you are aiming to tailor a website to work across a range of mobile devices or have built a fully custom, native application, we can turn your idea into reality.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="ipad">
        <h2>iPad</h2>
        <p>The iPad has already begun to redefine tablet computing. Different than just a "big iPhone" or a "laptop without a keyboard," the iPad offers an entirely different experience to users surfing the web, playing games, or sketching out ideas. Hundreds of major businesses have already published beautiful and compelling iPad applications on this platform geared toward the fun and playful consumption of information. Whether you want to  redesign a website to leverage the iPad's interface, build a custom application to showcase your business, or explore an idea for a novel product, we have the in-house expertise to make it happen.</p>

      <li id="web">
        <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>For the last three years we have developed web applications &mdash; exclusively with Ruby on Rails &mdash; to deliver rich user interfaces using standards-based HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We know our tools inside-out, whether it be scaling a Rails server to handle millions of hits a month or creating highly optimized Javascript for dynamic mobile web applications.</p>
