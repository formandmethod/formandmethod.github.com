          <h2 id="the_score">The Score</h2>
          <p>We've been working with theScore since August 2007 to develop a best-of-breed mobile sports platform.</p>

          <p>TheScore is serious about being a first-mover in the mobile space and our agile development process has delivered quick turn-around for new devices and features.</p>

          <p>We developed the Score Mobile backend using Ruby on Rails and have scaled it up to handle over 20 million hits a month. We've grown the platform to support over a dozen sports leagues which serves data for all of Score Mobile's devices including the iPhone App, Blackberry App, and mobile website.</p>

          <p>On the front-end we've designed and developed theScore's mobile website and iPhone App. We've managed to deliver a great user experience while consistently iterating on the app to deliver features such as live in-game updates, game blogs, and video highlights. But don't take our word for it; to date the app has had over 1.5 million downloads and sports a 4-star status with over 15,000 reviews.</p>

          <h2 id="targetivity">Targetivity</h2>
          <p>In early 2009 we were approached by the founders of Targetivity to revamp their ad-network platform: Affsession.  Affsession is unlike other projects on which we have worked because its focus is not upon delivering content to a large number of end-users.  Rather, the platform is geared toward gathering real-time, transient statistics and presenting them in a number of complex reports.  Basically, it is a web-based business intelligence tool geared toward analyzing revenue streams associated with social media advertising.</p>  

          <p>After a review of Affsession's requirements and current setup, we broke ground with Rails and leveraged EC2 to work closely with Targetivity's founders to rapidly iterate over the design, explore requirements, and develop features.  Extensive testing and some fancy tricks with traffic-duplicating proxies helped to ensure a seamless database, server, and DNS migration of their production environment, which is especially important for a business based on having constant uptime. HAML, SASS, jQuery, and Javascript present a wide array of reports that are built on a custom infrastructure that bypasses ActiveRecord support and talks directly to MySQL.</p>
