          <h2 id="the_score">The Score</h2>
          <p>We've been working with The Score since August 2007 to develop a best-of-breed mobile sports platform.</p>

          <p>The Score is serious about being a first-mover in the mobile space and our agile development process has delivered quick turn-around for new devices and features.</p>

          <p>We developed the Score Mobile backend using Ruby on Rails and have scaled it up to handle over 20 million hits a month. We've grown the platform to support over a dozen sports leagues which serves data for all of Score Mobile's devices including the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scoremobile-iphone-edition/id285692706">iPhone App</a>, <a href="http://www2.thescore.com/scoremobile/blackberry.aspx">Blackberry App</a>, and <a href="http://m.thescore.com/">mobile website</a>.</p>

          <p>On the front-end we've designed and developed The Score's mobile website and iPhone App. We've managed to deliver a great user experience while consistently iterating on the app to deliver features such as live in-game updates, game blogs, and video hilights. But don't take our word for it; to date the app has had over 1.5 million downloads and sports a 4-star status with over 15,000 reviews.</p>

          <h2 id="community_lend">CommunityLend</h2>
          <p>In January 2010 we helped launch CommunityLend.com, Canada's first peer-to-peer lending platform. Having worked with CommunityLend since 2007, we iterated over prototypes that brought them through multiple rounds of fundraising. To date, the platform has processed $100,000 in loan applications and registered over 700 Borrowers and Lenders.</p>

          <p>CommunityLend makes use of extensive integration with external services in order to verify user identity (Equifax eID Verifier), query the user's credit bureau (Equifax iDecision), and make deposits from and withdrawals to user bank accounts (Portfolio Plus). CommunityLend has been featured prominently in international journals such as The Wall Street Journal, the Financial Post, Investment Executive and The Globe and Mail.</p>

          <h2 id="targetivity">Targetivity</h2>
          <p>In early 2009 we were approached by the founders of Targetivity to revamp their ad-network platform: Affsession, a web-based business intelligence tool geared toward analyzing revenue streams associated with social media advertising.</p>  

          <p>The Affsession platform presented a distinct set of requirements around gathering real-time, transient statistics and presenting them in a number of complex reports. After a review of Affsession's existing setup, we broke ground with Rails worked alongside Targetivity's founders to rapidly iterate over the design, explore requirements, and develop features. Extensive unit and functional testing helped to ensure a seamless migration of their production environment, which is especially important for a business based on having constant uptime. The migration to Rails and an extensive test suite have enabled rapid maintenance, adaptation, and feature development. In turn, this has helped Targetivity deal with rapid growth amongst the ever-changing landscape of social media.</p>

        <h2>Philosophy and Process</h2>
        <div class="column col_1">
        <p>We absolutely love working with clients who share our passion for delivering compelling software experiences to their end users. We provide both design and development services under a single roof, which reduces communication overhead and exposes requirements to everyone involved. This allows us to deliver elegant, pragmatic, and adaptable solutions that fit our customers' evolving needs.</p>
        
        
        </div>
        <div class="column col_2">
        <p>We see immense value in getting real, working software in front of actual users as quickly as possible. All projects start with at least one developer and designer working with you to determine minimum requirements for delivering usable software to your users. At each step, we integrate user feedback to quickly iterate and improve upon your application.</p>
                    
        <p>We employ modern tools and techniques backed by best-practices and years of collective experience to build robust, scalable, and reliable products. Moreover, we strive to deliver code that is understandable, maintainable, and concise. Your time and money spent with us is an investment; you should not expect anything but the best.</p>

      <li id="iphone">
        <h2>iPhone</h2>
        <p>While many of today's cell phones can browse the web and download specialized applications, such functionality is often an afterthought. The iPhone, by contrast, is a fully-fledged platform that has come to define the state of the art in mobile applications. We have been writing apps since the App Store was first launched and, nowadays, are eagerly exploring the upcoming release that supports, amongst other things, background processes and multitasking. Whether you are aiming to tailor a web site to work across a range of mobile devices or have built a fully custom, native application, we can turn your idea into reality.</p>
      </li>
      <li id="ipad">
        <h2>iPad</h2>
        <p>The iPad has already begun to redefine tablet computing. Different than just a "big iPhone" or a "laptop without a keyboard", the iPad offers an entirely different experience to users surfing the web, playing games, or sketching out ideas. Hundreds of major businesses have already published beautiful and compelling iPad applications on this platform geared toward the fun and playful consumption of information. Whether it is redesigning a web site to leverage the iPad's interface, building a custom application to showcase your business, or exploring an idea for a novel product, we have the in-house expertise to make it happen.</p>

      <li id="web">
        <h2>Web</h2>
        <p>For the last three years we have developed web applications -- exclusively with Ruby on Rails -- to deliver rich user interfaces using standards-based HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We know our tools inside-out, whether it be scaling a Rails server to handle millions of hits a month or creating highly optimized Javascript for dynamic mobile web applications.</p>

        <p>has run the gamut on delivering high-tech products, from working in semiconductors in Silicon Valley to project management of a Montreal-based online dating business. In 2008, David entered the world of consulting and quickly became involved with Ruby-on-Rails and iPhone development. He has worked for clients such as ScoreMedia, CommunityLend, and Targetivity. David holds a BASc in Computer Engineering from the University of Waterloo (2001).</p>

        <p>is happiest when he's among fun people and working on fun things while solving complicated problems with simple and elegant solutions. He's worked on projects like real-time market data web displays for brokers, music grant application and jurying systems for the government, mobile sports scores apps for sports fans, and the first peer-to-peer lending platform for Canadians.

        <p>genuinely love building web apps in Ruby and Javascript. In the last two years he's worked on TheScore, Targetivity, and 4ormat. Before consulting full-time he spent three years at Amazon.com working on payment services in C++ before using Rails to build internal apps for managing Amazon's complex monitoring tools. In 2003, he graduated from the University of Waterloo in Computer Science and managed to do co-op jobs at five now-defunct startups. When he's not working he's reading far too much non-fiction and enjoying the quality pubs of Toronto.</p>

Despite a foray into the mysterious world of software development, he prefers to work in the world of front-end website development and design. He's a major advocate of developing standards-compliant and pragmatic code to create bulletproof and elegant web interfaces. His past projects include work for TheScore, the United Nations, the University of Toronto, CommunityLend, and Rypple. </p>
